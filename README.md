# py-Cifar10-CNN
This project demonstrates how to build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Keras to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The network is designed with multiple convolutional, dropout, batch normalization, and dense layers to achieve high accuracy in multi-class image classification tasks.
